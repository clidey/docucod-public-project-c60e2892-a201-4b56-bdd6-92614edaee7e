## Contribution Guidelines

Before making any changes, please take a moment to review the [Contributing Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md). This document covers best practices for submitting issues and pull requests, coding style, how to run tests if applicable, and how to engage respectfully with maintainers and other contributors.

## Ways You Can Contribute

### 1. Report Errors

If you come across typos, inaccuracies, broken links, or any other form of error, you can:

- Open an issue describing the problem clearly and, if possible, suggest how to fix it.
- Submit a pull request fixing the error directly with a concise explanation.

### 2. Improve Existing Sections

Help clarify explanations, add examples, or enhance formatting to improve readability and understanding.

- Provide clear, user-focused improvements.
- Keep technical language accessible, avoiding unnecessary jargon.
- Add cross-references and links to related content when appropriate.

### 3. Add New Content

Suggest or add entirely new sections or topics to cover system design concepts, workflows, or interview questions not currently included.

- Discuss proposed additions in an issue first to ensure alignment with project goals.
- Ensure new material fits logically within the existing structure.

### 4. Translate Documentation

Translations make this resource valuable to non-English speakers worldwide.

- Check the [Translations](TRANSLATIONS.md) page for the current status of language translations.
- If a language is "In Progress" or "Stalled," consider becoming an active maintainer.
- For new languages, open an issue to discuss starting a translation.

### 5. Other Contributions

- Enhancements to tooling, automation, or formatting processes.
- Providing real-world examples or case studies.
- Suggesting improvements to diagrams and visual aids.
