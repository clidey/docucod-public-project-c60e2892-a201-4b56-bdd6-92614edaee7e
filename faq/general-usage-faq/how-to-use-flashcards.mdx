# How do I use the Anki flashcard decks effectively?

This page guides you on integrating the provided Anki flashcard decks into your learning routine, maximizing the value of spaced repetition, and highlights where to download and how to use different decks focused on system design, exercises, and object-oriented design.

---

## What Are Anki Flashcards?

Anki is a popular flashcard app that uses **spaced repetition** — a technique proven to improve long-term memory retention by scheduling reviews just before you are about to forget information.

The System Design Primer offers several curated Anki decks specifically crafted to reinforce your understanding of key concepts, interview exercises, and object-oriented design patterns.

---

## Why Use Anki in Your System Design Study?

When preparing for system design interviews or trying to deeply learn distributed systems concepts, it's not just about reading passively. Active recall using flashcards combined with spaced repetition solidifies your knowledge and keeps critical ideas fresh in your memory.

For example, after reading about *database sharding*, you can review a question like:

> What are the main benefits and trade-offs of database sharding?

Regularly reviewing flashcards on topics like this ensures you remember both definitions and practical implications.

## Included Anki Decks

The Primer provides three main Anki decks:

| Deck Name                   | Focus Area                                     | Usage Scenario                                       |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **System Design**            | Key system design concepts and definitions     | Use to grasp foundational theory and principles       |
| **System Design Exercises**  | Common interview questions and problem scenarios | Use to practice problem-solving steps and patterns   |
| **Object-Oriented Design**   | OO design interview questions and solutions    | Use to master OO concepts used in design interviews   |

You can download these decks via the links provided in the Primer’s resources folder or from [AnkiWeb](https://apps.ankiweb.net/).

## How to Start Using the Decks

1. **Install Anki App:**

   Head to [https://apps.ankiweb.net/](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) and install the app on your preferred platform (Windows/Mac/Linux/iOS/Android).

2. **Import the Decks:**

   Download `.apkg` deck files from the Primer’s resource folder, then import them directly into Anki.

3. **Customize Your Learning Session:**

   Set daily study goals in Anki. Start with fewer new cards if you want to build steady momentum.

4. **Daily Practice:**

   Commit to daily review sessions, even if just for 10–15 minutes. Anki will guide you on what to review each day based on spaced repetition algorithms.

## Tips for Effective Use

- **Don’t Rush New Cards:** Learn each card fully before moving on. Correct understanding avoids building shaky foundations.

- **Review Missed Cards Often:** When you get a card wrong, revisit it until you feel confident.

- **Mix Decks Over Time:** Combine questions from system design fundamentals with hands-on exercises to continually refresh theory and application.

- **Use Card Tags:** Filter or focus on specific topics (e.g., caching, database scaling) as needed.

- **Add Personal Notes:** Enhance cards by adding your own examples or memory aids.

- **Sync Across Devices:** Keep your progress up-to-date by syncing your Anki decks across devices.

---

## Common Challenges & How to Overcome Them

- **Deck Overload:** Don’t try to do all decks at once. Prioritize system design deck first, then gradually add exercises.

- **Forgetting to Review:** Use Anki’s notifications or integrate it with your daily routine (e.g., morning or commute).

- **Abstract Concepts:** Use additional resources or videos alongside flashcards for difficult topics.
