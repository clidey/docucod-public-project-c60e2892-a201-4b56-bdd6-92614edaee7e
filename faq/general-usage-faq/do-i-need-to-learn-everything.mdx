## Do I need to know everything here for interviews?

This page outlines recommended study strategies tailored to your background, target companies, and interview timelines. It clarifies the breadth versus depth of knowledge required and how to tailor your study plan for success.

### 1. Understanding the Scope of Interview Preparation

System design interviews vary widely depending on several factors:

- **Your technical experience**: More experienced candidates are expected to know deeper system design concepts.
- **Your technical background**: Different backgrounds (frontend, backend, architecture) influence the focus.
- **The position you’re applying for**: Entry-level, mid, senior, or architect roles require different depths.
- **Company standards**: Some companies emphasize breadth; others expect deep specialization.

The reality is that **you do not need to master everything at once**. Interviews test relevant knowledge for the role and company.

### 2. Tailored Learning Based on Your Timeline and Goals

Below is a suggested approach reflecting your interview timeline and goals.

| Timeline       | Learning Focus                            | Practice Scope                                         |
|----------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| **Short term** | Gain breadth across key system design topics | Solve **some** interview questions                      |
| **Medium term**| Combine breadth with some depth            | Solve **many** interview questions                      |
| **Long term**  | Gain broad and deep understanding         | Solve **most or all** interview questions              |

This helps you efficiently allocate your preparation time without overwhelming yourself.

### 3. Broad Foundations Are Crucial

Start by building a broad understanding of system design concepts including:

- Scalability and performance trade-offs
- Architecture patterns (monolith, microservices)
- Database concepts (SQL vs NoSQL, indexing, sharding)
- Networking fundamentals (HTTP, TCP, UDP, REST, RPC)
- Caching strategies and asynchronous processing
- Load balancing and CDN usage

At minimum, you should be conversant with these ideas to discuss system designs intelligently.

---

### 4. Go Deeper Selectively Based on Role and Interest

Focus on a few key areas to deepen your knowledge relevant to your goals:

- For backend roles: focus on database scaling, caching, queuing, microservices.
- For infrastructure or architect roles: emphasize distributed systems, consistency models, fault tolerance.
- For frontend or full-stack roles: understand API design, REST vs RPC, CDN, and caching strategies.

Review real-world architectures of companies you’re interviewing with to identify commonly emphasized topics.

---

### 5. Leverage Practice Questions and Flashcards

Practice common interview problems and review sample solutions to solidify concepts. For example:

- System design interview questions with detailed discussions and sample solutions.
- Object-oriented design problems with diagrams and code examples.
- Flashcard decks for spaced repetition learning.

This helps reinforce theory with practical application and improves recall during interviews.

---

### 6. Use an Iterative Study Workflow

1. Start with broad concepts to frame the landscape.
2. Pick interview questions aligned with your timeline.
3. Dive deeper in areas exposed as weak or highly relevant.
4. Repeat and expand your study progressively.

### 7. Common Pain Points and How to Avoid Overwhelm

- **No one expects you to memorize everything**—understand core principles.
- Use curated study guides to pace yourself.
- Focus on principles over memorizing specific technologies.
- Balance breadth and depth to fit your timeline.

---

### 8. Example Study Plan Summary

- **Short timeline (1–2 weeks)**: Read overview chapters; solve select interview questions; focus on system types applicable to your role.
- **Medium timeline (1–3 months)**: Explore core components; practice many interview scenarios; work through foundational algorithms.
- **Long timeline (3+ months)**: Master all core topics; explore advanced scalability patterns; simulate interviews.

### Practical Tips and Best Practices

- Use your interview prep time wisely by focusing on your knowledge gaps.
- Discuss your reasoning during interviews rather than trying to recall memorized details.
- Incrementally increase study depth by tackling progressively harder questions.
- Utilize spaced repetition with flashcards to cement key terminology and patterns.
- Leverage diagrams to visualize system components and interactions.
