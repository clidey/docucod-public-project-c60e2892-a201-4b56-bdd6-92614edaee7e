## Common Problems and Solutions

### 1. Issues Opening Jupyter Notebooks

**Problem:** Unable to open or run the Jupyter notebooks included in the repository.

**Solution:**
- Ensure you have installed [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/install) or [JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/install).
- Confirm your Python environment meets the package dependencies.
- Open notebooks via the command line using:

```bash
jupyter notebook path/to/notebook.ipynb
```

or launch the entire notebook server from the repo folder:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

- If you see errors related to package imports, install the required packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- For help, visit the [Jupyter official troubleshooting guide](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/troubleshooting.html).

<Note>
Inconsistent or outdated Jupyter versions can cause notebooks to malfunction. Keeping Jupyter and related Python packages updated is good practice.
</Note>

### 2. Anki Flashcard Import Errors

**Problem:** The Anki flashcard decks fail to import or sync correctly.

**Solution:**
- Make sure you have the latest version of the [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) desktop application installed.
- Download the correct `.apkg` files from the resources folder:

  - `[System Design Deck](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer/tree/main/resources/flash_cards/System%20Design.apkg)`
  - `[System Design Exercises Deck](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer/tree/main/resources/flash_cards/System%20Design%20Exercises.apkg)`
  - `[Object Oriented Design Deck](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer/tree/main/resources/flash_cards/OO%20Design.apkg)`

- In Anki, use _File > Import_ and select the `.apkg` file.
- If decks are large or fail, try importing one deck at a time.
- Refer to the [Anki import troubleshooting guide](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer/issues/251) for known issues.

<Tip>
Regularly backing up your Anki collection before importing new decks is strongly recommended.
</Tip>

### 3. Missing Software or Dependencies

**Problem:** Required software or dependencies for running the notebooks or other resources are missing.

**Solution:**
- Install Python 3.7 or later from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- Install Jupyter and packages via:

```bash
pip install jupyter
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- For Mac users, tools like Homebrew can facilitate installation:

```bash
brew install python3
pip3 install jupyter
```

- For Windows users, consider using the [Anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual), which comes prepackaged with Python, Jupyter, and many common data science libraries.

- Refer to the [Prerequisites & System Requirements page](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer/blob/main/getting-started/introduction-setup/prerequisites-requirements.md) for detailed setup instructions.

<Warning>
Running notebooks or scripts with incompatible Python versions or missing libraries will cause execution errors.
</Warning>

### 4. Help with Git and Cloning Repositories

**Problem:** Trouble cloning the repo or updating to the latest version.

**Solution:**
- Install Git from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
- Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer.git
```

- Pull the latest changes periodically:

```bash
git pull origin main
```

- For detailed Git usage, check out [Git Basics](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Git-Basics).
