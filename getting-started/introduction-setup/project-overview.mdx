## How This Primer Fits in Your Interview Preparation

System design interviews are open-ended conversations expecting you to lead the discussion. Here's how the primer supports you:

- **Guidance on approaching problems:** Step-by-step methods to clarify requirements, design high-level architecture, detail core components, and scale the design.
- **Detailed solutions:** Annotated example problems with discussions, code snippets, and diagrams.
- **Tools for retention:** Spaced repetition flashcard decks (Anki) and interactive coding challenges.
