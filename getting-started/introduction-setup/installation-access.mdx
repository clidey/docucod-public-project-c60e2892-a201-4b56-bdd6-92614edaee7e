# Installation & Accessing Materials

Welcome to the initial setup guide for the System Design Primer repository. This page will help you **download or clone** the repository content across various platforms and get acquainted with the **directory structure** and location of key study assets including notebooks, Anki flashcard decks, written guides, and diagrams.

---

## 1. Acquiring the Repository

### Choose Your Method:

- **Clone with Git (Recommended)**
  - If you have Git installed, cloning the repo preserves history and enables easy updates.
  - Run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer.git
```

- **Download ZIP**
  - If Git is not installed, use GitHub’s "Download ZIP" button on the repository page.
  - Extract the contents to your desired folder.

- **Direct Access**
  - The repository is publicly available: [https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer)
  - You can browse files directly on GitHub or download individual assets.

### Platform Notes

- **Windows Users**: Use Git Bash or install Git for Windows for the best Git experience.
- **macOS/Linux Users**: Use the terminal’s native Git installation.
- **Permissions**: Ensure you have read access to the repository and sufficient disk space.

<Tip>
If you plan on contributing or keeping the repository up to date, cloning via Git is superior to downloading ZIP archives.

### Key Study Assets:

- **Anki Decks (.apkg files)** in `resources/flash_cards/`
  - Designed for spaced repetition learning
  - Can be imported into Anki app available on desktop or mobile

- **Notebooks & Code Solutions**
  - Located within `solutions/` subdirectories
  - Example notebooks provide interactive code for learning core concepts

- **Visual Guides & Diagrams**
  - Available under various folders in `resources/`
  - Useful for grasping architectural patterns and workflows

<Note>
Anki decks are useful for active recall. Make sure you have the latest Anki Desktop or mobile app before importing.
</Note>

## 3. Using the Anki Flashcard Decks

Follow these steps to utilize the flashcard decks effectively:

1. Download the `.apkg` files from `resources/flash_cards/`.
2. Open Anki application.
3. Select **File > Import** and choose the downloaded `.apkg` file.
4. Study the flashcards regularly using Anki’s spaced repetition algorithms.

<Tip>
The decks cover core system design principles, exercises for practice, and object-oriented design concepts tailored to interviews.
</Tip>

## 4. Navigating the Notebooks and Solutions

The repository includes Jupyter Notebooks (`*.ipynb` files) and other scripts to practice system design problems interactively.

- Found in `solutions/` directory
- Open notebooks using Jupyter:

```bash
# From repo root, activate environment with Jupyter installed
jupyter notebook
```

- Follow the notebook instructions to explore code examples step by step.

## 5. Troubleshooting Common Issues

- **Git Clone Fails:** Check for network restrictions or firewall blocks.
- **Importing Anki Deck Fails:** Update Anki to the latest version and verify file integrity.
- **Jupyter Notebooks Not Opening:** Ensure Python and Jupyter are installed correctly.
- **Missing File in Directory:** Confirm the repo is fully cloned or downloaded.

For further assistance, consult the [Troubleshooting Guide](/getting-started/validation-support/troubleshooting-common-issues).
