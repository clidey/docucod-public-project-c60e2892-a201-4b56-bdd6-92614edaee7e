## 1. System Requirements

To successfully use the study materials in this repository, ensure your system meets the following minimum specifications:

- **Operating System:** Windows 10 or later, macOS 10.13 or later, or most Linux distributions
- **Memory:** Minimum 4 GB RAM; 8 GB or more recommended for smooth running of Jupyter notebooks
- **Storage:** At least 2 GB free disk space for cloning the repository and dependencies
- **Web Browser:** Latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Edge, or Safari for reading guides and interacting with online content


## 2. Software Dependencies

### For Viewing and Running Content

- **Git:** To clone the repository
- **Python 3.7+** with the following packages for running Jupyter/IPython notebooks:
  - Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
  - `mrjob` (for MapReduce simulation code samples)
  - `ipykernel`, `nbconvert` (for notebook support)
- **Anki:** For flashcard study using the provided decks
- **Markdown Reader:** Most code and guides are in markdown format, any modern markdown viewer will suffice

### Recommended Installation Steps

1. Install Python:
   - Download the latest Python 3 version from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Install Jupyter:
   ```bash
   pip install notebook
   ```
3. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer.git
   ```
4. Install dependencies for notebooks (optional):
   ```bash
   pip install mrjob ipykernel nbconvert
   ```
5. Install Anki for flashcards:
   - Download from [Anki's official site](https://apps.ankiweb.net/).

## 3. Access Requirements

- Internet access is recommended for:
  - Cloning and updating the repository
  - Accessing linked external resources and references
- No accounts or special credentials are required to access or use any part of this repository.


## 4. Network Requirements

- No special firewall or open ports needed for reading the guides or running notebooks locally.
- For downloading dependencies, ensure your network allows outbound HTTPS connections.

## 5. Additional Considerations

- **Notebook Compatibility:** The IPython/Jupyter notebooks are compatible with Jupyter Notebook and JupyterLab. Using JupyterLab is recommended for better user experience.
- **Offline Use:** Once cloned and dependencies installed, the materials can be used offline.
- **Updates:** Occasionally pull updates from the GitHub repository to stay current with improvements and additional materials.
