## 3. Effective Use of Anki Flashcards

### Understanding Spaced Repetition

Anki uses spaced repetition to schedule flashcard reviews at increasing intervals based on your recall ease, which significantly improves long-term retention.

### Daily Study Routine

- **Consistency is key**: Aim to study a manageable number of cards daily to build momentum.
- **Active recall**: Try to answer before revealing the answer to maximize learning.
- **Use tags and filtered decks**: Focus on weaker topics or upcoming interviews by creating filtered decks.

### Best Practices

- Customize card scheduling if default intervals do not fit your pace.
- Add or edit cards if you want to make personalized notes or focus on tricky concepts.
- Regularly sync with AnkiWeb to keep your progress backed up and accessible across devices.

## 4. Tips for New Users

- Take advantage of Anki’s mobile apps to study on the go.
- Avoid cramming large numbers of new cards daily — this reduces effectiveness.
- Combine Anki with other study materials and hands-on exercises for holistic learning.

## 5. Troubleshooting Common Issues

*If you encounter problems importing decks or using Anki:*

- Ensure your Anki version is up-to-date.
- Verify that `.apkg` files are fully downloaded and not corrupted.
- Consult the official Anki documentation or community forums if issues persist.
