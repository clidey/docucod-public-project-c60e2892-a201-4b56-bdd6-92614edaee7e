- Familiarity with programming and design patterns.
- Access to this repository’s materials.

### Expected Outcome
By following this guide, you will:
- Know how to prioritize system design topics by importance and your interview timeline.
- Understand how to approach system design interview questions thoughtfully.
- Gain confidence in navigating the repository’s vast resources efficiently.

### Time Estimate
Varies depending on your engagement level:
- Short timeline: 1–2 weeks
- Medium timeline: 1–3 months
- Long timeline: 3+ months

### Difficulty Level
Beginner to Intermediate

## 2. How to Approach Your System Design Study

### Step 1: Understand Your Interview Timeline and Goals
Before you begin, assess how much time you have and your experience level. Align your focus according to these three categories:

| Timeline       | Focus                         | Practice                             |
|----------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Short timeline | Breadth of topics             | Solve some interview questions      |
| Medium timeline| Breadth and some depth        | Solve many interview questions      |
| Long timeline  | Breadth and more depth        | Solve most interview questions      |

Remember, you don’t have to master everything; interview expectations vary based on companies and roles.

### Step 2: Start with Key System Design Topics
Explore the [index of system design topics](#index-of-system-design-topics) to understand fundamental concepts such as scalability, caching, load balancing, and databases.

**Suggested starting steps:**
- Watch the [scalability video lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-W9F__D3oY4).
- Read the accompanying [scalability article](https://web.archive.org/web/20221030091841/http://www.lecloud.net/tagged/scalability/chrono).

### Step 3: Learn the High-Level Trade-Offs
Understand the critical trade-offs that form the foundation of system design:
- Performance vs scalability
- Latency vs throughput
- Availability vs consistency

These are essential to appreciate because every design choice involves trade-offs.

### Step 4: Explore Study Materials and Practice
Begin working through system design interview questions with solutions provided in the `solutions/` folder such as:
- Designing Pastebin or Bit.ly
- Designing the Twitter timeline and search
- Designing a web crawler

Try to actively compare your approaches with sample solutions including code and diagrams.

### Step 5: Use Anki Flashcards
Leverage [Anki flashcards](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) included in this repo for spaced repetition and retention of complex system design concepts.

Recommended decks:
- System Design
- System Design Exercises
- Object-Oriented Design Exercises

### Step 6: Iterate and Deepen Study
Applied consistent learning and practice, gradually increasing complexity and depth. Use the [how to approach system design interview questions](#how-to-approach-a-system-design-interview-question) section to master handling the open-ended system design interview conversations.

## 3. Step-by-Step Guidance for Tackling System Design Interview Questions

### Step 1: Define Use Cases, Constraints, and Assumptions
Begin your interview discussion by clarifying requirements.
Ask and state:
- Who will use the system and how?
- Expected user count.
- What inputs and outputs exist?
- Data volume anticipated.
- Read to write ratio.

Document assumptions explicitly.

### Step 2: Create a High-Level Design
Sketch the architecture outlining main components and their interactions.
Explain why each component exists and how it fits.

### Step 3: Design Core Components
Dive into important parts such as databases, APIs, and data models.
Give concrete examples, e.g., how a URL shortening service might generate and store hashes.

### Step 4: Address Scalability and Bottlenecks
Identify potential bottlenecks with your initial design.
Consider adding:
- Load balancers
- Horizontal scaling
- Caching layers
- Database sharding

Discuss the trade-offs involved.

### Bonus Tip: Use Back-of-the-Envelope Calculations
If asked, perform quick estimates on:
- Traffic volumes
- Storage needed
- Request rates

Use the [Appendix](#appendix) for latency numbers and powers-of-two references.

## 4. Examples of Interview Questions with Solutions

Access a curated list of questions with detailed answers in the repository's `solutions/` folder:
- [Pastebin.com or Bit.ly](solutions/system_design/pastebin/README.md)
- [Twitter Timeline and Search](solutions/system_design/twitter/README.md)
- [Web Crawler](solutions/system_design/web_crawler/README.md)
- [Mint.com](solutions/system_design/mint/README.md)

Work through the questions to understand how to design and explain large-scale systems.

---

## 5. Tips and Best Practices

- **Don’t rush to the final design:** Demonstrate iterative thinking — benchmark, profile, address bottlenecks, then refine.
- **Use practical trade-offs:** Discuss pros and cons transparently.
- **Start broad, then focus:** Gain a broad overview first before deep-diving into specific topics.

---

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Challenges

- Feeling overwhelmed by the breadth? Focus on core concepts first.
- Unsure what topics interviewers prioritize? Refer to the suggested study timelines.
- Difficulty with open-ended questions? Practice thought structuring using the stepwise approach in this guide.
