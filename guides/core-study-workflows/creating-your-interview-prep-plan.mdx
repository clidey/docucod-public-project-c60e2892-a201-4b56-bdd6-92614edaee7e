# Creating Your Interview Prep Plan

## Overview

This guide helps you craft a personalized system design interview preparation plan tailored to your experience, timeline, and target companies. It offers practical advice on balancing breadth and depth of study and strategically mapping topics and practice questions to maximize learning efficiency.

## Prerequisites

- Basic familiarity with system design concepts.
- Access to system design study materials and practice questions (recommended).

## Expected Outcome

By following this guide, you will have a clear, actionable prep plan aligned with your individual needs, helping you maximize your interview readiness efficiently.

## Time Estimate

Varies depending on your timeline, ranging from a few weeks to several months.

## Difficulty Level

Beginner to Intermediate

---

## Step 1: Assess Your Starting Point and Goals

1. **Evaluate your current experience level.**
   - Are you new to system design concepts or have prior exposure?
   - Have you previously attempted system design interviews?

2. **Clarify your timeline.**
   - How long until your target interview date?
   - What is your weekly availability for study?

3. **Identify your target companies and their expectations.**
   - Are the companies more focused on breadth or depth of system design knowledge?
   - Review any publicly available interview content or feedback.

<Tip>
Early self-assessment aligns your efforts and prevents overwhelm by focusing on what truly matters.
</Tip>

## Step 2: Determine Breadth vs. Depth Approach

Depending on your time and experience, choose your focus:

- **Short timeline & less experience:**
  - Focus on broad coverage of system design topics.
  - Prioritize common, high-impact areas.
  - Practice a subset of frequently asked interview questions.

- **Medium timeline & some experience:**
  - Balance breadth with deeper exploration of core topics.
  - Broaden the range of practice questions and include partial walkthroughs.

- **Long timeline & experienced:**
  - Dive deeply into advanced topics.
  - Practice extensive questions with full design walkthroughs.
  - Study real-world architectures and advanced trade-offs.

<Callout>
Consistency over intensity is key. Schedule regular, focused study sessions matching your plan.

## Step 3: Map Topics to Practice Questions

Use the system design topic index to identify subjects to study and match them to representative questions:

| Scenario                | Topics to Cover                                  | Sample Questions           |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Broad coverage           | Core concepts, architecture patterns, databases, caching, scalability | Pastebin, Twitter timeline  |
| Intermediate depth      | Detailed database scaling, caching strategies, communication patterns  | Mint.com, Amazon sales rank |
| Deep dive               | Real-world architectures, microservices, advanced consistency models  | Web crawler, Mint.com       |

<Check>
Each practice question should be accompanied by reading the corresponding documentation and reviewing diagrams and code examples for deeper understanding.
</Check>

## Step 4: Build a Weekly Study Plan

Structure your preparation week-by-week:

1. **Review core concepts** before each set of practice questions.
2. **Dedicate sessions** to reading documentation, watching videos, and reviewing sample designs.
3. **Practice designing systems aloud** or in writing to simulate interview conditions.
4. **Incorporate active recall** using Anki flashcards integrated with your study.
5. **Schedule periodic reviews** of previously studied topics to reinforce knowledge.

<Tip>
Use timers or the Pomodoro technique to maintain focus during study sessions.
</Tip>

---

## Step 5: Leverage Additional Resources

- **Anki flashcards** for key system design terms and principles.
- **Visual study guides and diagrams** to internalize architectural patterns.
- **Public real-world architecture blogs** to understand practical implementations.

Refer to these guides for integrated studying:

- [Using Anki Flashcards Effectively]( /guides/core-study-workflows/using-anki-flashcards-effectively )
- [Learning from Real-World Architectures]( /guides/best-practices-real-world/using-reference-architectures )

---

## Step 6: Adjust and Iterate

As you progress:

- Collect feedback from mock interviews or self-assessments.
- Adjust your study plan to focus on weaker areas.
- Increase complexity and scope as your confidence grows.

<Warning>
Avoid jumping straight to advanced topics without solid fundamentals.
</Warning>

---

## Troubleshooting Common Challenges

- **Overwhelm with content:** Narrow down to core topics and priority questions.
- **Difficulty understanding trade-offs:** Use real-world examples and case studies.
- **Dry theory without practice:** Balance study with active mock system design sessions.
- **Lack of resources:** Utilize the curated list of linked materials within the Primer.

<Tip>
Consistency and iterative learning are more effective than cramming.
