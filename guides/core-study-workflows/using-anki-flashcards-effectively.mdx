# Using Anki Flashcards Effectively

Leverage the curated Anki flashcard decks to build strong, lasting retention of key system design and object-oriented concepts. This guide walks you through setting up the decks, establishing daily study habits, and seeing how to integrate spaced repetition into your learning workflow for maximal impact.

---

## Workflow Overview

### What This Guide Will Do for You

This guide is designed to help you integrate Anki flashcards into your system design interview preparation by demonstrating how to effectively import, organize, and review the flashcard decks. You'll learn to apply the spaced repetition model used by Anki to achieve long-term retention of complex system design topics and object-oriented principles.

### Prerequisites

- Have Anki installed on your device. Download it from [Anki Official Website](https://apps.ankiweb.net/).
- Download the provided Anki decks to your local machine:
  - **System Design Deck**
  - **System Design Exercises Deck**
  - **Object Oriented Design Exercises Deck**

### Expected Outcome

- Successfully import the official flashcard decks into Anki.
- Establish a daily flashcard review routine following effective spaced repetition principles.
- Enhance your understanding and recall of system design and object-oriented design fundamentals progressively.

### Time Investment

- Initial setup: 5-10 minutes
- Daily review: 20-30 minutes to maintain a manageable daily workload

### Difficulty Level

- Beginner to Intermediate, accommodating users new to Anki or flashcards.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Importing Anki Decks

Begin by importing the `.apkg` files into your Anki application.

1. Open Anki.
2. Go to **File > Import...**.
3. Navigate to the folder where you saved the flashcard decks.
4. Select a deck file (e.g., `System Design.apkg`) and select **Open**.
5. Repeat for each deck:
   - System Design Deck
   - System Design Exercises Deck
   - Object Oriented Design Exercises Deck

**Result:** The imported decks appear on the main Anki screen under your collection.

<Tip>
If you encounter import errors, ensure you are using the latest version of Anki. Also, re-download the decks if necessary, and check the [Anki Flashcard Deck Won't Import—What Should I Do?](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer/wiki/Anki-flashcard-deck-won't-import-%E2%80%94-what-should-I-do) troubleshooting page.
</Tip>

### 2. Organize Your Decks

- Consider reviewing decks in this order:
  1. **System Design Deck** — for foundational concepts.
  2. **System Design Exercises Deck** — apply core ideas with practice questions.
  3. **Object Oriented Design Exercises Deck** — deepen object-oriented design skills.

- Use Anki’s **Deck Options** to adjust daily new card limits and review settings to balance workload.

### 3. Establish Your Daily Review Workflow

The power of Anki is in **spaced repetition** — reviewing flashcards at intervals optimized for memory retention.

- Every day, open Anki and click on each deck to start reviewing due flashcards.
- Answer each flashcard honestly:
  - If you know the answer well, mark it as "Good" or "Easy".
  - For more challenging cards, mark "Hard" or "Again" to see them sooner.

Consistent daily reviews ensure you cover new material while reinforcing previously learned content just before forgetting.

### 4. Integrate Flashcard Study with Broader Prep

- Use flashcards as quick knowledge checks between deeper study sessions such as reading system design topics or practicing whiteboarding.
- Carry Anki decks on your phone to reinforce learning during commutes or breaks.

## Practical Tips & Best Practices

- **Start Small:** Set Anki’s new card limit initially to 10-20 per day to avoid burnout.
- **Prioritize Active Recall:** Always try to recall answers before flipping the card.
- **Use Tags and Filters:** Filter cards by topic or difficulty to focus on weaker areas.
- **Customize Cards:** Add personal notes or mnemonic devices to cards where helpful.
- **Consistent Timing:** Try to review at roughly the same time each day to build a habit.

---

## Common Pitfalls & Troubleshooting

### Flashcard Overload

If you fall behind and accumulate thousands of due cards:
- Temporarily increase your daily review and new card limits.
- Focus on cards marked difficult.
- Consider suspending the least relevant cards.

### Deck Import Issues

- Verify that the deck files are not corrupted.
- Use the latest version of Anki.
- Refer to the [troubleshooting guide](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer/wiki/Anki-flashcard-deck-won't-import-%E2%80%94-what-should-I-do).

### Syncing Problems

- Use AnkiWeb to back up and sync cards across devices.
- Always sync before and after study sessions to prevent data loss.

## Examples of Effective Use

**Scenario:** You have 30 minutes during lunch.

- Open Anki and start with the System Design deck.
- Review 15 new cards and 20 due cards.
- Mark each answer honestly.
- Finish with 5 minutes reviewing challenging cards from the Object Oriented Design deck.

Results in solidifying new information and reinforcing older knowledge.

**Phone Use Case:** Use Anki’s mobile app during commutes.

- Review cards in short bursts without distractions.
- Utilize mobile sync to keep progress updated.
