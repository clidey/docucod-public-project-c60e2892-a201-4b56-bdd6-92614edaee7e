# Databases, Consistency & Availability

Explore the landscape of data stores—relational, document, key-value, wide-column, graph—and how they manage trade-offs between consistency, availability, and partition tolerance. Understand the CAP theorem and how it applies to real system choices.

## Understanding Databases: Types and Trade-offs

Databases are foundational to most large-scale systems. Choosing the right type depends on your application requirements, data structure, scalability needs, and consistency guarantees. Let’s explore key categories of databases and their characteristics.

### 1. Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS)

RDBMS like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle store data in structured tables with defined schema. They support ACID transactions ensuring atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability.

#### Key Features
- Structured and consistent data storage
- Strong schema and support for complex joins
- Support transactional guarantees (ACID)

#### Scaling Strategies
- **Master-slave replication:** Master handles writes and replicates to read-only slaves
- **Master-master replication:** Multiple nodes accept read and write operations (careful with conflicts)
- **Federation:** Break databases by function to reduce load and latency
- **Sharding:** Partition database horizontally to distribute data across servers
- **Denormalization:** Store redundant data to reduce costly joins, boosting read performance
- **SQL Tuning:** Optimize queries and indices to improve performance

#### Common Trade-offs
- Strong consistency but harder to scale horizontally
- Complex joins can lead to performance bottlenecks on large data
- Replication lag may cause stale reads

### 2. NoSQL Databases

NoSQL databases relax some ACID properties to gain scalability and flexibility. They are broadly categorized as key-value, document, wide-column, and graph.

#### Key-Value Stores
- Simplest form, analogous to hash tables
- Extremely fast O(1) reads/writes, typically in-memory or SSD backed
- Minimal query capabilities; complexity shifts to application layer
- E.g., Redis, Memcached

#### Document Stores
- Store data as documents (JSON, XML, BSON)
- Allow querying based on document structure
- Flexible schema; documents in collections can vary in fields
- E.g., MongoDB, CouchDB, DynamoDB

#### Wide-Column Stores
- Data organized in column families, optimized for reads on large datasets
- Provide high scalability and availability
- E.g., Bigtable (Google), HBase, Cassandra

#### Graph Databases
- Store nodes and edges, optimized for complex relationships like social networks
- Newer technology with smaller ecosystem
- E.g., Neo4j, FlockDB

#### Characteristics
- BASE semantics: Basically Available, Soft state, Eventual consistency
- Prioritize scalability and high availability over immediate consistency

### 3. SQL vs NoSQL: When to Use Which?

| Use Case                 | SQL (RDBMS)                     | NoSQL                            |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Schema                   | Structured, fixed schema        | Flexible, dynamic schema        |
| Relationships            | Complex join support            | Limited or no join              |
| Scalability              | Vertical scaling or complex horizontal (sharding) | Horizontal scaling built-in     |
| Consistency              | Strong consistency (ACID)       | Eventual consistency (BASE)     |
| Data Size                | Generally smaller datasets      | Handling TB/PB scale data       |
| Use-cases                | Financial, transactional systems, legacy | Big data, real time, rapidly changing data |

## The CAP Theorem: Consistency, Availability, Partition Tolerance

In distributed systems, the CAP theorem states you can only guarantee two out of these three simultaneously:

- **Consistency (C):** Every read sees the latest write
- **Availability (A):** Every request receives a non-error response (not guaranteed latest)
- **Partition tolerance (P):** System continues to operate despite network partitions

Since network partitions are inevitable, systems must choose between:

- **CP systems:** Favor consistency at the expense of availability during partitions (may have high latency/failures)
- **AP systems:** Favor availability at the expense of consistency during partitions (provide eventual consistency)

### Consistency Models in Practice

| Pattern           | Description                                                    | Example Use Cases                |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Weak consistency  | Reads after write may or may not see written data             | VoIP, games with tolerable lags |
| Eventual consistency | Reads see the write eventually (milliseconds delay)           | DNS, email systems               |
| Strong consistency | Reads always see latest write immediately                      | File systems, banking systems   |

## Availability Patterns

High availability is pursued through redundancy:

### Failover

- **Active-passive:** Primary active node handles traffic; standby node takes over on failure
- **Active-active:** Multiple nodes handle traffic simultaneously; load balanced

Shortcomings:
- Additional hardware required
- Potential data loss if failing node hasn't replicated latest writes

### Replication

- Allows data duplication across multiple nodes
- Supports read scalability and fault tolerance
- Challenges include replication lag and consistency conflicts

## Key Takeaways for System Designers

- Every database and storage choice reflects trade-offs between consistency, availability, scalability, and complexity.
- RDBMS offer strong consistency but need sophisticated strategies to scale out.
- NoSQL databases prioritize scalability and availability, accepting eventual consistency.
- CAP theorem is a core decision framework: availability or consistency when network splits occur.
- Choose consistency model and database type based on application domain needs and tolerance for stale or conflicting data.

## Troubleshooting Common Challenges

- **Database bottlenecks:** Identify read-heavy vs write-heavy loads; consider replicas and caches.
- **Replication lag:** Consider consistency needs; possible stale reads.
- **Scaling writes:** Use sharding or denormalization.
- **Choosing consistency:** Understand your usage pattern tolerance and criticality of data freshness.
