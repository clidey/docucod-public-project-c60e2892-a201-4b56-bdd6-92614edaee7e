# Core System Design Concepts

Gain a grounding in the basic terminology and thinking models in system design, including definitions of scalability, performance, availability, and consistency. This page introduces key trade-offs every engineer faces and frames how to approach architectural decisions.

## Introduction to System Design Thinking

System design is fundamentally a trade-off exercise, involving choices among competing priorities: performance, scalability, availability, consistency, and cost. Understanding these key concepts helps engineers frame architectural decisions that balance these attributes to fit specific application requirements.

This guide lays the foundation to think systematically about system design aspects crucial for building robust, scalable distributed applications.

## Fundamental Terms

### Scalability

**Scalability** describes a system's ability to handle growing amounts of work by adding resources proportionally. It enables a system to serve more users or process larger data volumes without dropping performance.

- *Vertical scaling* involves boosting resources (CPU, RAM, disk) on a single machine.
- *Horizontal scaling* involves adding more machines to work in parallel.

### Performance

**Performance** focuses on the speed of operations, including response time and throughput:

- *Latency* is the time it takes to complete an operation.
- *Throughput* is the number of operations per unit of time.

Optimizing for performance involves minimizing latency while maximizing throughput.

### Availability

**Availability** is the probability that a system is operational and accessible when needed.

Measured in terms of uptime expressed as “nines” (e.g., 99.9% or “three nines” means system downtime of less than 9 hours per year).

### Consistency

**Consistency** indicates how similar returned data is for all users or components that access the system at the same time:

- *Strong consistency* means every read returns the latest written value.
- *Eventual consistency* means that, given no new writes, all replicas eventually converge to the same value.

### Fault Tolerance

Ability of a system to continue operating properly in the event of the failure of some of its components.

## High-Level Trade-offs in System Design

Every system design decision requires trade-offs. Key trade-offs include:

### Performance vs. Scalability

- **Performance** focuses on fast operations for current load.
- **Scalability** emphasizes the system’s growth handling capability.

You can have great performance but poor scalability (system slows with load) or good scalability but mediocre individual operation performance.

### Latency vs. Throughput

- Systems must balance **latency** (response time) with **throughput** (total processed requests).
- In many cases, there is a trade-off between low latency and high throughput.

### Availability vs. Consistency (CAP Theorem)

- In distributed systems, based on the [CAP theorem](#cap-theorem), you can only have two of three guarantees: Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance.
- Partition tolerance is mandatory in distributed systems.
- Systems often choose either CP (Consistency + Partition tolerance) or AP (Availability + Partition tolerance), depending on your use case.

## Core Concepts Explained

### 1. Scalability

A scalable system's performance improves proportionally with additional resources. Scaling approaches:

- *Vertical scaling* (scale up): Upgrade a single machine.
- *Horizontal scaling* (scale out): Add more machines. This is preferred for large-scale systems for cost and reliability.

### 2. Performance Metrics

- Latency: Total time to complete a request (e.g., 100ms per API call).
- Throughput: Number of requests processed per second (e.g., 1000 QPS).

Optimizing performance requires reducing average latency for the acceptable workload, and maximizing throughput without saturating resources.

### 3. Availability

Availability measures the fraction of time a system is operational.

Typical SLA targets:

| Availability | Downtime/year   |
|--------------|-----------------|
| 99.9%        | ~8.7 hours      |
| 99.99%       | ~52.6 minutes   |
| 99.999%      | ~5.3 minutes    |

### 4. Consistency Models

- **Strong consistency**: All users see the latest data immediately.
- **Eventual consistency**: Updates propagate asynchronously.
- **Weak consistency**: Reads may not reflect recent writes.

Design for consistency depends on what the application tolerates.

## CAP Theorem: Understanding Trade-offs

In a distributed system, [CAP theorem](http://robertgreiner.com/2014/08/cap-theorem-revisited) hypothesizes only two of the following three can be guaranteed simultaneously:

- **Consistency (C):** All nodes see the same data at the same time.
- **Availability (A):** Every request receives a (non-error) response.
- **Partition Tolerance (P):** System continues to operate despite network partitions.

Since network failures are unavoidable, modern systems must choose between **Consistency** and **Availability**.

- **CP systems** favor consistency over availability.
- **AP systems** favor availability over consistency.

Knowing your business requirements helps pick the right side of the trade-off.

## Designing for Scalability and Availability

### Scaling Approaches

- **Horizontal scaling**: Add more servers. Requires stateless services or externalizing state (e.g., sessions stored in a cache).
- **Load balancing**: Distribute traffic evenly.
- **Caching**: Reduce load on backend systems, speed up response times.

### Fault-tolerant Design

- Redundancy: Multiple instances for high availability.
- Failover mechanisms: Active-passive or active-active setups.
- Partition tolerance: Design system to handle network partitions gracefully.

### Consistency Patterns

- Choose between consistency levels: strong, eventual, or per-use case.
- Understand impact on system complexity and user experience.

## Practical Tips for System Design Decisions

- Start simple: Build a minimum viable architecture.
- Profile and benchmark: Identify real bottlenecks.
- Understand traffic patterns: Read-heavy or write-heavy?
- Use caches wisely to handle uneven load distributions.
- Design asynchronous processing for heavy workloads where possible.
- Plan for gradual migration and refactoring when scaling existing systems.
